# config-nvim-ds

## Introduction

Let's start with reasons for existence of this repo:

* After too much time with VSC - I thought I needed a change; Long story short - I ended up refreshing memory in terms of vim-motions
* Besides working config - goal is to have multi-file clear and well documented config
* Focus on the Data-related activities - Python (output similar to JupyterLab) + DB-related activities #SQL
* There's a chance that future updates will push me towards creation of some plugins for the nvim judging on the current "market" in terms of the data science-related solutions for nvim
* Of course, of course, backup of config, useful when you need to work on multiple machines

## Goal:

* Create an update tool for the purposes related to my job and other personal projects

## Other:

* Current font of preference: JetBrainsMono Nerd Font Mono

## To Do:

* add plugin for the DB-related activities #SQL (LSP, Formatting, Linter, Clear GUI without cluttering, performance measures, etc.)
* add plugin for the Jupyter-like experience for the data exploration (not necessary dedicated to python)
